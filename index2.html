            What is front-end development? The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including design and some languages like HTML and CSS. 
            There are a lot of different jobs associated with the front-end. 
            Keep in mind that a lot of these titles are subjective, so while front-end developer may mean something at one company, it can mean something completely different at another company.

         <h2>Back end</h2>
         <p id="p__2">What is back-end web development? The back-end, or the "server-side", is basically how the site works, updates, and changes. 
            This refers to everything the user can't see in the browser, like databases and servers. 
            Usually people who work on the back-end are called back-end programmers or back-end developers. 
            back-end Developers are mostly worried about things like security, structure, and content management. 
            They usually know and can use languages like HTML and CSS, but it’s not their focus.
